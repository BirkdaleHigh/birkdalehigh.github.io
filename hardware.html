      <h3>Coding House Rules</h3>
      <p>These rules are adapted from the <a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/house-rules">BBC Micor:bit rules</a> and are in general good rules for everywhere.</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Don't use your full name or social media handle in your Usernames.</li>
            <li>Don't reveal any personal information about yourself or others in your script, comments or feedback, such as your full name, phone numbers or email addresses, as it might put you or someone else at risk.</li>
            <li>No nasty, offensive or rude comments. Sharing your opinion is fine as long as it is said politely and fairly, but being mean, bullying and/or causing arguments is not allowed.</li>
            <li>No swear words or other content that is likely to offend or cause distress, including racist, sexist, homophobic, disablist or sexually explicit content.</li>
            <li>No links to inappropriate or offensive content.</li>
            <li>No unsuitable films, bands or TV shows. Children aged 11 attend the school. This means you cannot refer to certificate 15 or 18 films and games, TV programmes shown after 9pm, or bands that use bad language.</li>
            <li>No foreign languages. Unfortunately we can't allow scripts or text written in a language that isn't English. Everything that is published on the site will be post-moderated and we can't accommodate any other languages.</li>
            <li>Don't impersonate someone else.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Git</h3>

      <p>Our code at birkdale is saved using software called git, git lets you look at the history of any line and read comments about why it changed. It's a perfect resource for learning from. On GitHub click on the history button when looking at any file to view what changes it has had. Clicking on those will show you the <a href="https://github.com/BirkdaleHigh/sketch/commit/1a34c19a9f9f0c021b9752ea6ea670bc767a16ec">difference.</a></p>
