      <h3>How to Git</h3>

      <p>Our code at birkdale is tracked using software called git, this simply allows you to look at the hisory of any line text and read comments about why it's there. It's a perfect resource for learning from. From github click on the history button when looking at any file to view what changes it has had. Clicking on those can show you the difference e.g <a href="https://github.com/BirkdaleHigh/sketch/commit/1a34c19a9f9f0c021b9752ea6ea670bc767a16ec">Example.</a></p>
